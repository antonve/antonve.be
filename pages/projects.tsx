          Tadoku is a friendly foreign-language immersion contest and tracking
          platform aimed at building a habit of reading and listening in your
          non-native languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          A minimal viable product was tested in 2019 and the website officially
          launched in 2020. About 100 people participate per official contest, a
          number which is steadily growing.

          Wantedly is a technology company which offers a social recruiting and
          employer branding platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018 they wanted to revamp their iOS app in order to increase the
          monthly active users. I was part of the team that built the new Visit
          app.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main contributions were towards the onboarding flow, LinkedIn &
          Facebook authentication, and the profile screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The revamp was well received and lead to a significant increase in
          people applying to jobs.

          I was the first engineer on the international expansion product team.
          I was responsible for the growth of the product in Singapore,
          Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built a variety of features to support our international growth such
          as an email template manager for marketers in local markets, online
          payments in Singapore with Stripe, a new onboarding flow, and more. A
          chunk of my time was spent analyzing user behavior. Those results were
          then used to figure out what to focus on next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wantedly Visit is originally built as a monolithic Ruby on Rails
          application. During my time there we slowly migrated to a microservice
          architecture running on Kubernetes.
